# RGB LED controlling with Android Things on Raspberry Pi 3

## Describe
 + Using three pins to control an RGB LED displaying in different colors.
 + Get input from a button and then change the pace of color displaying (ex 1). For example, the RGB LED changes colors in 2s by default. After a button is pressed, the rate will change to 1s, then 0.5s, 0.1s and back to 2s. 
 + Similar to exercise 1, control the RGB LED by using PWM to change the brightness of the led. Please read this link for more details of PWM
 + Get input from a button and change the brightness of each color of the RGB LED. For example, the RGB LED changes the brightness of red, green, blue by default. After a button is pressed, only the red one is changing its brightness, then green, blue and back to three colors.
+ Blink each LED in different paces. The RED LED is blinking every 0.5s, the green is 2s, and the blue is 3s.
